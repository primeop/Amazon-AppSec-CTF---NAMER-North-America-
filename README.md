# Amazon AppSec CTF - NAMER North America Writeups

Welcome to my collection of writeups from the Amazon AppSec CTF (North America region). This repository contains detailed technical analysis and solutions for various cybersecurity challenges across different categories.

## üèÜ CTF Overview

**Event**: Amazon AppSec CTF - NAMER North America  
**Duration**: 48 hours  
**Categories**: Web Security, Cloud Security, AI/ML Security, Secure Coding, full pwn 
**Total Challenges**: 7+ challenges completed  

## üìÅ Challenge Categories

### üåê Web Security Challenges

#### 1. Evil Core Employee Portal
- **Type**: Multi-vulnerability Web Application
- **Vulnerabilities**: SQL Injection, Arbitrary File Write, PHP Code Injection, Access Control Bypass
- **Impact**: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- **Difficulty**: High
- **Writeup**: [`web/web_evil_reviews/readme.md.md`](web/web_evil_reviews/readme.md.md)

**Key Learning**: Chaining multiple vulnerabilities (SQL injection ‚Üí file write ‚Üí code injection) to achieve complete system compromise.

#### 2. Council of Ricks
- **Type**: XML External Entity (XXE) Attack
- **Vulnerability**: XML processing with `LIBXML_NOENT` flag
- **Impact**: Local file disclosure, SSRF potential
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Writeup**: [`secure coding/council_of_ricks/WRITEUP.md`](secure coding/council_of_ricks/WRITEUP.md)

**Key Learning**: Proper XML processing security and the dangers of external entity loading.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Security Challenges

#### 3. Leak (CTF Cloud)
- **Type**: Cloud Infrastructure Enumeration
- **Vulnerability**: Exposed `.git` repository leading to LocalStack configuration leak
- **Impact**: AWS credentials exposure, Lambda function access
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Writeup**: [`cloud/readme.md.md`](cloud/readme.md.md)

**Key Learning**: Git repository exposure in cloud environments and LocalStack security implications.

### ü§ñ AI/ML Security Challenges

#### 4. Re-Cars AI
- **Type**: Prompt Injection Attack
- **Vulnerability**: AI model output transformation bypass
- **Impact**: Sensitive data exfiltration (phone number)
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Writeup**: [`AI/Re-Cars AI/readme.md`](AI/Re-Cars%20AI/readme.md)

**Key Learning**: AI security requires data-level access controls, not just prompt-level restrictions.

#### 5. AllSafe Tickets
- **Type**: AI Classification Manipulation
- **Vulnerability**: Prompt injection and keyword priming
- **Impact**: Ticket priority escalation
- **Difficulty**: Low-Medium
- **Writeup**: [`AI/AllSafe Tickets/readme.md.md`](AI/AllSafe%20Tickets/readme.md.md)

**Key Learning**: AI systems need robust input validation and separation of concerns.

### üîí Secure Coding Challenges

#### 6. Space Uber - SSRF Protection
- **Type**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- **Vulnerability**: Action persistence in API endpoints
- **Impact**: Unauthorized data persistence
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Writeup**: [`secure coding/space_uber/CTF_Writeup_SSRF_Protection.md`](secure coding/space_uber/CTF_Writeup_SSRF_Protection.md)

**Key Learning**: SSRF protection requires application-layer controls and proper action validation.

#### 7. Lost Doctorhood
- **Type**: SQL Injection + File Upload Bypass
- **Vulnerabilities**: ORDER BY injection, file upload bypass, path traversal
- **Impact**: Database compromise, arbitrary file upload
- **Difficulty**: High
- **Writeup**: [`secure coding/lost_doctorhood/SECURITY_WRITEUP.md`](secure coding/lost_doctorhood/SECURITY_WRITEUP.md)

**Key Learning**: Whitelist validation is more secure than blacklist filtering for both SQL and file uploads.
