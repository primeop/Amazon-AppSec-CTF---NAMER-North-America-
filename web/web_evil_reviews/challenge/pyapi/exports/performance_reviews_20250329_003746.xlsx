2,Elliot Alderson,Tyrell Wellick,3,"While Elliot's technical capabilities are undeniable, I have serious concerns about his adherence to company policies and chain of command. His recent security audit of the Steel Mountain facility, while thorough, was conducted without proper authorization. His behavior sometimes exhibits a concerning pattern that could potentially compromise our security protocols.

I recommend close supervision and possible psychological evaluation before granting higher security clearances. Despite these concerns, his technical contributions remain valuable to Evil Core's mission.",2023-12-20
3,Elliot Alderson,Phillip Price,2,"I've been monitoring Mr. Alderson's activities with great interest. His technical brilliance is matched only by his unpredictability, which makes him both an asset and a liability. His recent discovery of vulnerabilities in our Global Debt Ledger security deserves recognition, but his methods are concerning.

Employees like Elliot require special handling - too much pressure will break them, too little oversight and they become dangerous. I'm authorizing continued employment with restricted access to critical systems. His potential usefulness outweighs the risk, for now.

WATCH CLOSELY. If his behavior becomes more erratic, immediate termination may be necessary.",2023-12-30
4,Elliot Alderson,Elliot Alderson,3,"I believe my technical skills are strong, but I'm aware that my communication with the team could use improvement. I often work independently and sometimes forget to document my findings or inform management about security issues I discover. I've been working on several side projects to improve our security infrastructure, though some of these haven't been formally approved. My attendance could be better - sometimes I get caught up in work and lose track of time. I'm committed to improving in these areas while continuing to strengthen our security posture.",2025-03-29
